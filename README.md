# Vanilla JS

This project is based on a series of tutorials available [here](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/series/vanilla.js) so credit 
due to Jeremy for his blog.

The overarching goal of this project is to demonstrate the first steps towards building HTML templates from Javascript.

This repo focuses on the introductory, data-binding and single-page application elements of the blog series, and,
are respectively marked part 1, 2 and 3.

The project was written in the eyes of a Java developer, so the comments dispersed throughout the project assume said viewpoint.
