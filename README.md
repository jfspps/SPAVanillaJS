# Vanilla JS

This project is based on a series of tutorials available [here](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/series/vanilla.js) so credit 
due to Jeremy for his blog.

The overarching goal of this project is to demonstrate the first steps towards building HTML templates from Javascript.

+ Part 1 : Introduction (defining button behaviour through JS and fetching data from web services)
+ Part 2 : Data-binding
+ Part 3 : Single-page application

The project was written in the eyes of a Java developer, so the comments dispersed throughout the project assume said viewpoint.

Please note, that there are potential security flaws with Part 2's data-binding. These concerns are not rectified here.
