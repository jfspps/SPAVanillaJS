# Single Page applications with vanilla JS

This project is based on a series of tutorials available [here](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/series/vanilla.js) so credit 
due to Jeremy for his blog.

The overarching goal of this project is to demonstrate the first steps towards building HTML templates from Javascript.

+ Part 1 : Introduction (defining button behaviour through JS and fetching data from web services)
+ Part 2 : Data-binding (responding to real-time changes to HTML element values e.g. input elements)

The project was written in the eyes of a Java developer, so the comments dispersed throughout the project assume said viewpoint.
Both parts should serve as good introductory examples about how a single HTML template is constructed and updated through Javascript.

Please note, that there are potential security flaws with Part 2's data-binding. These concerns are not rectified here.
